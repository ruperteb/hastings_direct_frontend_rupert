# Hastings Direct Technical Assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project (utilising [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/)), aimed at presenting a mock news website homepage.

## Preliminary

- Ensure that dependencies are installed. As this version of Next utlises the React 19 RC, using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag may be required (i.e. `npm run i --legacy-peer-deps`)
- Replace the base segment (i.e. `/path/to/`) of the image url paths in the associated Node backend application with `/images/`
- Ensure that the backend application is running and listening on port 3002

## Running the application

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
